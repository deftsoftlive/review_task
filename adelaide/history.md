<center><h2>Heritage Building</h2>
<p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>In the second half of the nineteenth century, the East End Market Hotel was built as part of the Vaughan’s Fruit and vegetable market, and was licensed as early as 1868. The building was purpose build for the 'farmers, market gardeners, produce dealers, and public’. As a Market Hotel, the place was permitted to stay open for the publican's wine during hours which were prohibited for hotels not associated with Market activities. It was a privilege conferred by a private act of Parliament, The East End Market Act of 1872. 

The facade and verandah of the building remains an important part of the streetscape of East Terrace fronting the parklands. Historically, the building hotel, is a physical reminder of the East End Market which functioned around this site in the 1850s. All elements of the verandah are all well conserved, including the ground floor cast iron columns, first floor timber columns, balustrading and top rail. On the eastern elevation, the front walls on both ground floor, first floor and parapet details remain original. 

In more recent history, up until 2017, the building was used as The Irish pub, P.J. O’Brien’s.
Henceforth, the time has come for this historic building to turn the page, B’churrasco. Please feel free to look around, speak to the crew in the kitchen and that way we can get a good family spirit inside the restaurant. We hope you enjoy your time in our unique venue as much as we do. </strong></p>
